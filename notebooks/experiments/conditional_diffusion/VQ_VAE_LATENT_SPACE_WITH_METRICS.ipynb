    "\n",
    "1. Additional metrics to validate the approach: [NOTE: some of these metrics can be repurposed for the UNET (stable diffusion part)]\n",
    "\n",
    "       a) **METRIC 1**, Recovery, defined as the percentage of fully (meaning not just parts of the sequence for)  predicted/recovered motifs from the validation set [Similiar metric is used in molecular generation as well]\n",
    "       b) **METRIC 2** Partial recovery, defined as the percentage of the motifs where we predicted atleast RECOVERY_THRESHOLD correctly, independent wether the whole sequence was predicted correctly. This RECOVER_THRESHOLD is a variable, so if we set it 50% then we count the percentage of motifs where we recovered atleast 50% of the nucleotides of that sequence.\n",
    "       b) **METRIC 3** Accuracy, defined as the percentage of nucleotides that we predicted correctly, independent wether the whole sequence was predicted correctly.\n",
    "       c) **METRIC 4**, Seperation of the latent space using low dimensional visuals, UMAP. If we can see clear seperation in lower dimensional space, that means that latent variables are not bad.\n",
    "       d) **METRIC 5** Seperation of the latent space using low dimensional visuals, non-linear projection t-SNE. If we can see clear seperation in lower dimensional space, that means that latent variables are not bad. \n",
    "       e) **METRIC 6**, Comparing different lengths of motifs (7-9-11) to a Jaspar vertrabrates DB using gimme scan.\n",
    "       f) [weak metric/proxys] **METRIC 7**, observing the composite loss and perplexity during training. Perplexity should go up and composite lose should go down. \n",
    "       \n",
    "**Perplexity**: In the context of a VQ-VAE (Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder), perplexity is a measure of how well the model can reconstruct a given input. It is defined as the exponentiated average log-probability of the input, where the log-probability is computed using the model's decoder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perplexity can be thought of as a measure of how \"surprised\" the model is by the input. A low perplexity indicates that the model is able to reconstruct the input well and is not surprised by it, whereas a high perplexity indicates that the model is unable to reconstruct the input well and is surprised by it.\n",
    "\n",
    "***NOTE : For all 7 Metrics (except recovery, there we rebuild little 100% of motifs, which is a good thing, we dont want to overfit) we observe favorable trends, where we can infer that the learning happens and we are finding a desired representation!***  \n",
    "   \n",
    "2. Split the test set into 3 distinct chromosomes, with expectation that different chromosomes will have different latent space. The same analysis should be repeated for different cell types.\n",
    "3. Complete pre-refactoring of the code, cleaning and writing doc strings. This is ready to be copied and merged into codebase.\n",
    "4. Adjusted the architecture for the VQ-VAE from https://github.com/zalandoresearch/pytorch-vq-vae\n",
    "5. Added theoretical explanations and motivations of different parts of the code.\n",
    "6. Reconcile different things between baseline stable diffusion nb and this one (similiar functions, variable naming, descriptions etc) such that refactoring is easier."

    "c) **METRIC 4**, Seperation of the latent space with visuals. We know that per Cell Type there should be different distributions if learnt properly. Used three different methods here. First T-SNE visualisation, PCA to relatively rank the latent space and then plot them using UMAPs. PCA explains more then 0.96 of the variance with only 10 latent features. 0.5 of the variance is explained with 3.\n",
